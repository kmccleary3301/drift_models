# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly before maintainers can triage.

Report via private communication to project maintainers with:
- affected file/module,
- reproduction steps,
- impact assessment,
- suggested mitigation (if available).

## Scope

This repository is a research reproduction codebase; security hardening is best-effort.

Priority areas:
- dependency vulnerabilities,
- unsafe artifact loading behavior,
- command-injection vectors in scripts,
- credential handling and accidental secret exposure.

## Response goals

- Initial acknowledgement: within 7 days.
- Triage and severity assessment: as soon as practical.
- Patch timeline: based on severity and maintainers' capacity.

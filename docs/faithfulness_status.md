# Faithfulness Status

This page is the claim-boundary summary for paper-faithfulness posture.

## Current status

- Repository is an active reproduction project, not a final faithfulness claim.
- Latent pipeline is under ongoing parity hardening with evidence tracking.
- Pixel pipeline remains experimental.
- Long-horizon evidence runs are required before paper-level result claims.

## Evidence sources

- `docs/reproduction_report.md`
- `docs/experiment_log.md`
- `docs/eval_contract.md`
- `docs/claim_to_evidence_matrix.md`

## Allowed vs disallowed claims

### Allowed now

- “Community PyTorch reproduction in progress.”
- “Includes drifting objective, queue pipeline, and evaluation contract tooling.”
- “Provides closest-feasible single-GPU protocols and extensive smoke/testing coverage.”

### Not allowed now

- “Paper-level metric reproduction is complete.”
- “Paper-faithful parity is closed across all pipelines.”
- “Official implementation.”
